# SwapShift #

This project is a solution to the issue of swapping shifts with coworkers. 
It is developed in C++ using the Qt GUI library for the desktop application and QML (Qt Markup Language) for the mobile app.

It consists of:
* A **desktop application** for managers to upload rosters, view them and edit employee lists 
* A **mobile app** for employees to manage the swapping of shifts 
* A **MySQL database** used to send data between the managers end and the employee's end
